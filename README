[ 1. DESCRIPTION ]

    TcpTurbo is a high-performance system daemon designed to accelerate
    TCP throughput and reduce latency on Linux-based gateways and servers.
    It combines aggressive kernel-level sysctl tuning with a zero-copy
    TCP relay service utilizing the splice(2) system call.

    The project is intended for users who need to squeeze every bit of
    performance out of high-latency or high-loss network environments.


[ 2. KEY FEATURES ]

    - KERNEL TUNING: Automated application of Google BBR congestion control,
      FQ queuing discipline, and expanded TCP window scaling.
    - ZERO-COPY RELAY: High-efficiency port forwarding using Linux splice
      technology, bypassing user-space memory copying.
    - LIVE DASHBOARD: Real-time monitoring of retransmission rates, 
      segment flow, and throughput via IPC.
    - DAEMONIZATION: Runs as a background service with Systemd integration.
    - BUSY_POLL: Low-latency socket polling for high-performance I/O.


[ 3. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ]

    - OS: Linux (Kernel 4.9 or higher for BBR support)
    - COMPILER: GCC 7.0+ or Clang 5.0+ (C++17 Support Required)
    - BUILD TOOLS: CMake 3.10+, GNU Make
    - PRIVILEGES: Root access required for sysctl and CAP_NET_ADMIN


[ 4. BUILD & INSTALLATION ]

    The project includes an automated build system.

    1. Build the binaries:
       $ chmod +x build.sh
       $ ./build.sh

    2. Install to system:
       $ sudo ./build.sh

    This will install the binary to /usr/local/bin and register the 
    'tcp_turbo' service with Systemd.


[ 5. COMMAND LINE INTERFACE ]

    USAGE: tcp-turbo <command> [options]

    COMMANDS:
      start             Launch the background daemon.
      stop              Terminate daemon and revert kernel changes.
      enable            Apply extreme sysctl optimizations.
      disable           Revert to system default network settings.
      relay <ip> <port> Start zero-copy relay to target destination.
      dashboard         Enter the live monitoring interface.
      custom "k=v,..."  Apply user-defined sysctl parameters.


[ 6. TECHNICAL INTERNALS ]

    - IPC: Communication between CLI and Daemon via Unix Domain Sockets
      located at /tmp/tcp_turbo.sock.
    - RELAY ENGINE: Uses epoll(7) in Edge-Triggered (EPOLLET) mode.
    - DATA PLANE: Splice(2) is used to move data between the client 
      socket and the server socket via a kernel pipe buffer, achieving 
      near-wire speed with minimal CPU overhead.
    - STATS: Parsed directly from /proc/net/snmp for kernel-level
      accuracy regarding TCP retransmissions.


[ 7. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ]

    include/        - Header files (Class definitions)
    src/            - Implementation files
    build/          - Compilation artifacts

[ 8. DISCLAIMER ]

    TcpTurbo modifies critical kernel network parameters. While these 
    settings are optimized for high-speed throughput, they may not be 
    suitable for all network environments. Use with caution on 
    production systems.
